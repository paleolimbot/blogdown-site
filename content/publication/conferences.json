The paleolimnological approach can be used to reconstruct variability of water quality parameters over longer time scales in contrast to the limited range of limnological studies, providing the necessary context in which to decouple natural and anthropogenic change in lacustrine systems. Alta Lake, in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, is a small, recreationally important lake. Using a 210Pb and 14C dated sediment core, long-term changes in water quality were reconstructed using C/N stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N), metals, and historical records. Evidence was found for a large-scale influx of terrestrial carbon at 1563±98 AD and channel avulsion on the 21-Mile Creek alluvial fan at 1754±81 AD. Changes in stable isotopes beginning at 1949±17 AD indicated increased productivity in response to nutrient loading from septic-derived nutrients. Increased metal deposition (Cu, As, and Zn) during the same period indicates that watershed disturbance during the construction of the highway was likely a significant contributor of metals to Alta Lake. Previous 1-2 year limnological assessments of Alta Lake concluded that Alta Lake is an oligotrophic, clear-water lake with excellent water quality. This study confirmed these data but indicated that nutrient loading and increased productivity in Alta Lake continue to occur. The application of the paleolimnological method to the assessment of Alta Lake confirmed that the suite of abiotic proxies used was effective in characterizing long-term trends in water quality, and that a long-term perspective on water quality variability is necessary to develop effective management practices for Alta Lake and other small, economically important lakes.","URL":"https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2016NE/webprogram/Paper272385.html","DOI":"10.1130/abs/2016NE-272385","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.

Nova Scotia has a >300 year history of watershed alteration and impact.  Water quality, habitat stability and bioavailability of metals in lakes are a significant concern and resource managers lack effective water quality risk assessment techniques. We use applied paleolimnological techniques including X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technology to address specific knowledge gaps and decouple the effects of within lake stressors (primarily acidity and anoxia) from watershed scale disturbance.\n\nPaleolimnological investigations in the Cumberland Marsh Region (CMR) and Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) provided  insight into the influences of water column chemistry (salinity, pH, Eh, etc.), sediment composition and changing environmental conditions on metal (As, Pb, Fe, Mn) sequestration and mobility in lake sediments.  Studies in HRM noted persistent increases in a variety of toxic trace metals that are associated with mining in the 1800s. Remobilization of legacy mining waste remaining in soils was a significant source of recent lakebed sediment contamination. In the CMR, high Pb concentrations in lakebed sediments and gastropods correlated with water column salinity and sulphide content. Lead bioavailability may be most strongly associated with the form of Pb and sediment composition.\n\nIn all studies we were able to use the paleolimnological method and XRF analyses of lakebed sediments to link changes in abiotic proxies in sediment cores to the known history of the lake basin, leading to a better understanding of how lakes and watersheds react to anthropogenic influence.  The outcomes of private sector partnerships have indicated that rapid technology and competency transfer is possible, the approach is cost and time effective and can be integrated into the companies’ service portfolio. Our public partners have used the information to make informed management decisions. These experiences indicate that application of the paleolimnological approach has the potential to provide researchers with access a wide range of projects and funding sources.","URL":"https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2016NE/webprogram/Paper272067.html","DOI":"10.1130/abs/2016NE-272067","author":[{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.S."},{"family":"Dunnington","given":"D.W."},{"family":"White","given":"Christopher E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,23]]},"publisher-place":"Albany, New York"},

The Border Marshes are located along the Atlantic migratory flyway and are particularly important for waterfowl and marshbird production providing both migration and breeding habitat. Though ecosystem integrity has been studied extensively, there are no records of the physical and chemical evolution of lakes in the CBM. In this study we use the paleolimnological method at Long Lake to construct a 10,000 year record of both natural and anthropogenically influenced change.\n\nThe paleolimnological records were derived from percussion and gravity cores and indicate that Long Lake was a productive, fresh water lake from at least 10,500 cal. BP, long before most lakes in the CBM were established. Increases in various metals including Pb, As and Hg in the core at about  5000 cal. BP are likely the consequence of regional fires, and indicate that a significant reservoir of these metals exists in the natural environment.  The fire events are broadly coincident with a period of widespread drying from 8000 to 4000 cal. BP. Wetter conditions and a raised water table have persisted at the site since 4000 cal. BP.  Though tidal range had increased by this time, δ13C data indicate that long-term marine incursions did not occur at the Long Lake site. The gravity core data indicate that physical and biological character of Long Lake has been fundamentally altered in the last 300 years by anthropogenic activity.  Evidence of water level lowering and forced sediment aggradation (tiding) in the 1800s was found, consistent with historical records.  Increases in metals near the top of the core are likely associated with fossil fuel combustion and naturally occurring lead mobilized by sediment re-suspension and mixing associated with boat traffic. Collectively these data indicate that Long Lake may be one of the oldest lakes in the Cumberland Basin marshes and has been fundamentally altered by anthropogenic activity in the last 300 years. The sediments in Long Lake may also represent a source for the bioaccumulation of specific metals.","DOI":"10.4138/atlgeol.2015.005","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."},{"family":"White","given":"Hilary"},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.

Traditional in-situ remediation techniques have used natural precipitation and leachate recovery with some success, however sporadic quality assessment of recovered fluids yields limited control over leachate disposal methods and real-time assessment of remediation programs.  Evaluation of existing systems suggested that continuous monitoring of leachate quality, automated control and routing of the recovered fluids would further increase the efficiency of remediation process.  \n\nThe remediation technique implemented at the site includes installation of a flow-computer monitored and controlled leachate collection and recovery system enhanced by surface irrigation and subsurface injection.  Installation of continuous monitoring and automated control within the leachate recovery portion of the in-situ remediation system provides data recording, communications support, electrical conductivity (EC) monitoring, and valve control.  A flow-computer directs recovered fluid with low EC values toward a series of surface irrigation and subsurface injection systems, or concentrated brine with high EC values toward a series of storage tanks for subsequent deep-well injection.  Additional wells and routing options provide further controls on the remediation program.  The program demonstrates how modern technologies can be used to fuel developments in alternative in-situ remediation for salt-impacted soils, providing further opportunities for cost-effective, successful remediation.","URL":"https://www.esaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12-Ratiu.pdf","author":[{"family":"Ratiu","given":"Ion"},{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10]]},"publisher-place":"Banff, Alberta"},

In Atlantic Canada, historical logging and watershed development for hydroelectric power generation have significantly altered flow dynamics and seasonal discharge in forested upland river systems and yet the ecological impact and environmental legacy of these practices is not well understood. In this study, the bulk geochemistry of a 14C and 210Pb-dated sediment core from a fluvial lake on the West Branch of the Avon River, Nova Scotia, Canada was used to elucidate the environmental impact of these practices.\n\nSub-bottom sonar was used to located a deep-water coring site where current was minimal and sediment accumulation had occurred. Three environmental periods were recognized in the sedimentary archive. The pre-disturbance (pre-1890 AD) period was characterized by coarse sediment, low carbon concentrations and relatively high metal loads. Increasing strontium may be associated with substantial anadromous fish residency. Significant environmental impact is evident in the last 150 years. Logging and hydraulic disruption during the second period (~ 1890 – 1910 AD) resulted in multiple unconformities and fluctuations in watershed stability proxies (particle size, Ti, K, total C/N, 13C, 15N) that collectively indicate significant forest floor, bankside and basin erosion. Hydroelectric damming, a reduction in watershed area, and a reduction in discharge during the third period (~1920 to Present) has resulted in a decrease in particle size and an increase in algal matter. Fluvial erosion decreased during this period along with concentrations of most metals. Modern logging techniques in the watershed over the past 40 years appear to have had little impact on sediment bulk geochemistry. Low strontium in this interval may indicate a reduction in anadromous fish in the river system coinciding with the installation of dams and the construction in 1970 of flood control gates downstream from the site. Collectively these data indicate that fluvial lakes can contain robust records that can be used to provide guidance for watershed scale assessment of environmental impact.","URL":"https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2018NE/webprogram/Paper311065.html","title-short":"IMPACT OF HISTORICAL LOGGING AND HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT ON AN UPLAND RIVER SYSTEM, NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Godfrey","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.S."},{"family":"Mallory","given":"Mark L."},{"family":"Dunnington","given":"D.W."},{"family":"White","given":"Chris E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,18]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,22]]},"publisher-place":"Burlington, Vermont"},

In this study, we assessed pXRF data quality for use with aquatic sediments, including the precision of replicate pXRF measurements, repeatability among multiple pXRF analyzers, and accuracy of pXRF elemental concentrations as compared to certified reference materials (CRMs). Precision was assessed using relative standard deviation (RSD) of replicate measurements, repeatability was assessed using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (r^2^) and Spearman's rank-order correlation (r~s~) among multiple pXRF analyzers using identical\nsamples, and accuracy was assessed using r2 and rs values between CRM certified values and pXRF measured values. The data quality of elemental pXRF measurements was not identical when assessed for precision, repeatability, and accuracy: for our suite of aquatic sediment samples and CRMs, pXRF measurements were both precise and repeatable for Fe, Ti, Mn, K, Rb, Zn, Zr, V, Pb, As, and S; and pXRF measurements were precise, repeatable, and accurate for Fe, Ti, K, Rb, Zn, As, and S. Portable XRF has many advantages, including portability, wide availability, low cost, non-destructive analysis, and short sample analysis time. Our data suggest that pXRF can provide a high level of data quality for elemental geochemistry when applied to aquatic sediments. Many of the elements that demonstrated a high level of data quality are frequently used as indicators of landscape change; use of pXRF in these studies may enable investigators to measure samples at a higher resolution or to include more cores in their analyses.","URL":"https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2018NE/webprogram/Paper310613.html","DOI":"10.1130/abs/2018NE-310613","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.

Dedicated programs have attempted to ameliorate these problems, but the storage format used can be inflexible and/or proprietary, limiting the exchange of data and replicability of visualizations and statistical analyses. This poster conceptualizes values as having qualifiers (e.g. core identifier, depth below surface, and measured parameter) and tags (e.g. amount of error, number of replicates, written notes pertaining to the value), each of which are represented differently depending on the data structure used. This poster identifies four data structures among many as optimal for storing paleolimnological data: a raw values list, a summarized values list, a raw values matrix, and a summarized values matrix. The former two are long-format structures that store each qualifier category as a column (e.g. core identifier, depth, and parameter) with one row per measured value. The two later structures are wide-format structures that store the values for each measured parameter in separate columns. Summarized variants store one value per unique depth, whereas raw variants are able to store values for each replicate. Long data structures store tags more easily than wide data structures, however wide data structures are used more often as input for plotting routines and statistical analyses optimized for paleolimnological data. The conversion between these four structures is easily accomplished using both interactive (e.g. spreadsheet software) and programmatic (e.g. R and Python) mechanisms. As more advanced statistical treatment of data becomes common in paleolimnological studies, storing data in its most flexible form may be advantageous to enhance the replicability of visualizations and statistical analysis. Readily available conversion mechanisms ensure storing data in its raw form is not a barrier to fast and effective completion of this process.","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"D.W."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5]]},"publisher-place":"Kingston, Ontario"},

As the cost of treatment is directly impacted by changes in metal concentrations, dissolved organic carbon, and other water quality parameters, watershed managers have a vested interested in obtaining information about inter-annual to centennial scale changes that predate the monitoring record for each reservoir. From a scientific perspective, the availability of long-term monitoring data for drinking water reservoirs is conducive to informing interpretation of bulk geochemical proxies from these lakes. In partnership with Halifax Water, 6 sediment cores were taken from 3 surface water reservoirs within the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Preliminary data from lakebed sediment cores at Pockwock Lake and Lake Major suggest that changes in water quality occurred in response to early logging and lake level rise following the construction of a dam in each lake. The magnitude and nature of further water quality changes will be further constrained by pending C/N stable isotope data and ^210^Pb chronology.

Stable Pb is present in measurable concentrations in many lake sediments, is easily and cost-effectively measured, and often follows a regional pattern of increase following aerial deposition of particulates from industrial development. We measured stable Pb concentrations in seven ^210^Pb-dated sediment cores near Halifax, Nova Scotia using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Pb concentrations ranged from non-detect (~2 ppm) to 155 ppm, with a substantial increase observed between 1900 and 1930. Peak lead concentration dates were variable, but generally ocurred between 1970 and 1990. The timing of the initial increase was within the range of ^210^Pb age-depth model error for all lakes, suggesting a common aerial source for lead in the Halifax region. Using stable Pb concentrations, ^210^Pb age-depth model error, and rescaling methods, a unified stable Pb sediment chronology was constructed for the Halifax region.

Maritime Canada has experienced significant historic land disturbance through forestry, water-level change, and urbanization, and is thus an ideal place to investigate the relationship between long-term trace metal accumulation and catchment land-use change. Using ^210^Pb-dated gravity cores from 22 Maritime-Canadian lakes with varied land-use histories, we reconstructed trace metal accumulation and watershed disturbance at decadal resolution over the past ~200 years. Preliminary results from the greater Halifax region suggest that Fe, Mn, and As are particularly sensitive to oxygen conditions at the sediment-water interface, and that increased Cu was associated with the onset of urbanization in some urbanized watersheds. The mean timing of increased Pb deposition occurred at AD 1921±42 in the Halifax region and was consistent with atmospheric deposition from the use of leaded gasoline, however only in some lakes have Pb concentrations decreased since the phasing out of lead in gasoline. Collectively, our data suggest that that that historic sources of trace metals to Maritime Canadian catchments are still contributing to the contemporary trace metal load in lake sediments, and must be considered in the management of these systems.","DOI":"10.4138/atlgeol.2019.005","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"D.W."},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.

Stable Pb is present in measurable concentrations in many lake sediments, is rapidly and cost-effectively measured, and often follows a regional pattern of increase following aerial deposition of particulates from industrial development. To establish the degree to which stable Pb can be used as a reliable stratigraphic marker in lake sediments, we measured stable Pb concentrations in 20 ^210^Pb-dated sediment cores in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, Canada, using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Pb concentrations ranged from non-detect (2 ppm) to 250 ppm, with a substantial increase observed between 1900 and 1930. Peak lead concentration dates were variable, but generally ocurred between 1970 and 1990. Lakes with an earlier rise in stable Pb concentration tended to have historical coal-fired activity nearby (within 5 km), and one lake had Pb mining within the catchment, which led to a Pb concentration controlled by watershed disturbance. For most lakes, the timing of the initial increase was within the range of ^210^Pb age-depth model error, suggesting that this marker could be used to construct or validate age-depth models in recent lake sediments.","author":[{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.

Pockwock Lake, the primary drinking water supply for the City of Halifax, Nova Scotia, has experienced increased pH and NOM resulting in treatment challenges and increased operating costs. Halifax Water has been collecting chemical water quality data throughout the lake and tributaries since 2008, however water-column biological activity in Pockwock Lake is not well-characterized. We analyzed a dated lake sediment core for historical zooplankton (Cladocera) abundance in combination with previously-obtained sedimentary diatom abundance data to evaluate historical water-column biological activity. A significant change in Cladocera assemblages throughout the Pockwock core is present, corresponding with acidification and lake recovery trends. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is used to complement bio-proxies and expand the range of organisms detectable in lake sediments. The combined use of the subfossil morphological identification and sequenced genes can provide powerful results which can inform long-term planning, monitoring and management of drinking water reservoirs.","author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"Heather E."},{"family":"Dunnington","given":"Dewey W."},{"family":"Kurek","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Krkošek","given":"Wendy H."},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.

The Cumberland Marsh Region on the Nova Scotia - New Brunswick border is an important waterfowl refuge where arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) that exceed sediment quality guidelines (SQG) are widespread. The role of variable water column chemistry and nutrient load on metal retention and mobility in wetland sediments is not well understood. Laytons Lake, in the Amherst Marsh, Nova Scotia, was documented in the 1970s as becoming a density stratified, incompletely mixed (meromictic) lake by a sudden marine inundation which resulted in a saline bottom layer and a fresh top layer. New water column chemistry data indicate that the lake is no longer saline and has since mixed. A detailed paleolimnological assessment has been undertaken to investigate how these water column chemistry changes have influenced metal retention. Limnology and geochemical analysis of lake sediments using a portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) analyzer, total C, total N and stable isotopes (δ15N, and δ13C) will be used to determine how salinity changes influence nutrient availability and the retention of As and Pb in aquatic sediments. Preliminary results indicate Laytons Lake is now dimictic with the former dense saline layer no longer present and average conductivity of 503 μs/cm at the surface and 1012 μs/cm at 11 m. When the lake was meromictic the average conductivity was 538 μs/cm at the surface and 26,000 μs/cm at 11 m. It is nutrient rich (high TP) averaging 0.09 mg/L at the surface and 0.42 mg/L at 10 m depth. A depth-time profile of 100 years was established for the core based on the Pb curve. The Pb curve indicates atmospheric deposition is considerable and correlates with lead curves from other lakes in the region. Arsenic indicates a slight increase associated with the salt- water inundation. Distinct sediment stratigraphy compares with chemical changes seen in the pXRF data.","DOI":"doi:10.4138/atlgeol.2017.014","author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"Heather E."},{"family":"Loder","given":"Amanda L."},{"family":"Mallory","given":"Mark L."},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.

The site was dammed in 1967, effectively converting it into a shallow freshwater lake (140 ha, 4 m max. depth). The lake bottom sediments in Boat Harbour reflect both estuarine and fresh water environments, and can be broadly characterised as grey marine clay (50% water content) which is overlain by black, organic-rich sediment (90% water content). The contact between these two units is sharp and is present through the basin. To inform post- remediation management decisions the marine sediment was analysed for the spatiotemporal distribution of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ti, Zn, Mo, and Ni, which were identified as uniquely representative of impact at the site. The samples were collected using a gravity corer, were analysed for metal concentrations using a portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) analyzer and ICP-MS techniques and distribution was modelled using QGIS. Preliminary results indicate that As, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Pb concentrations at reference sites meet or exceed interim sediment quality guidelines. Metal loads in the grey marine clay at the impacted site are similar to or higher than those at the reference sites. Metals in the marine sediment at the impacted site and the reference sites show little stratigraphic variability, indicating that overprinting of contaminants from the overlying organic sediment at the impacted site is not likely. Spatial distribution maps of metals are being completed; preliminary results indicate substantial variability in metal concentrations spatially. These data must be taken into consideration in both the remediation and compliance stages of environmental assessment at the site.","DOI":"doi:10.4138/atlgeol.2017.014","author":[{"family":"Davidson","given":"Kirklyn Barry"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Baillie E.J."},{"family":"Spooner","given":"I.
