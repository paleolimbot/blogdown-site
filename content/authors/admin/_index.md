Dewey Dunnington is an environmental researcher, programmer, and educator based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Deweyâ€™s environmental research investigates the mechanisms that control toxic metals in lakes, while his programming has led him to develop mobile applications, web apps, and R packages, most recently as the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) summer intern with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). He has developed and taught many courses on R programming, Python programming, and GIS, and is a [RStudio-certified tidyverse instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers). He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in the [Centre for Water Resources Studies](http://waterstudies.ca/) at Dalhousie University.
