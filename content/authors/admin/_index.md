Dewey Dunnington is an environmental researcher, programmer, and educator based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Dewey’s environmental research investigates the mechanisms that control toxic metals in lakes, while his programming has led him to develop mobile applications, web apps, and R packages, most recently as the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) summer intern with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). He has developed and taught many courses on R programming, Python programming, and GIS, and is a [RStudio-certified tidyverse instructor](https://rstudio-trainers.netlify.com/). He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in the [Centre for Water Resources Studies](http://waterstudies.ca/) at Dalhousie University.
